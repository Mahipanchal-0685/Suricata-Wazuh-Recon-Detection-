# Suricata-Wazuh Recon Detection

## Overview

This project demonstrates the detection of Nmap reconnaissance activity using Suricata IDS and Wazuh.

A Kali Linux VM was used to perform an Nmap scan against an Ubuntu server running Suricata and Wazuh. Suricata generated alerts which were processed and visualized in the Wazuh Dashboard.

---

## Environment

* Kali Linux VM (Attacker)
* Ubuntu VM (Target & Monitoring)
* Suricata IDS
* Wazuh Manager
* Wazuh Dashboard

## Challenges Solved

### Issue 1: Suricata Service Failure

Suricata failed to start because the configured rule path did not match the actual generated rule location.

### Issue 2: No Events in eve.json

Suricata was monitoring the wrong network interface (`eth0` instead of `enp0s3`).

### Resolution

The rule path and monitored interface were corrected, allowing Suricata to successfully detect and log network activity.

## Results

* Successfully simulated reconnaissance activity using Nmap
* Generated Suricata alerts
* Verified events in `eve.json`
* Integrated alerts with Wazuh
* Confirmed alert visibility in the Wazuh Dashboard
